2Ô∏è‚É£ Importing and querying data from Google BigQuery
3Ô∏è‚É£ Using SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT for data extraction
4Ô∏è‚É£ Performing INNER JOIN to merge data from multiple tables
5Ô∏è‚É£ CRUD operations in MySQL
6Ô∏è‚É£ Database design with Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)
7Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced SQL techniques like Joins, UNION/UNION ALL, CTEs, and Window Functions (rank(), dense_rank())
8Ô∏è‚É£ Correlated nested queries, stored procedures, query optimization, and ACID properties

Completing this module has strengthened my foundation, and I‚Äôm excited to take on more data-driven challenges in the future!
